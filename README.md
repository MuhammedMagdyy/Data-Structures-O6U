## Introduction

Data structures are essential tools for organizing and managing data in computer science and programming. This repository aims to provide C++ implementations of different data structures, along with explanations of their functionalities and usage.

## Data Structures

This repository currently includes implementations of the following data structures:

1. Linked List
2. Stack
   - Implementing Stack using Array.
   - Implementing Stack using LinkedList.
   - Checking braces is balanced.
   - Evaluate postfix expression.
   - Infix to postfix.
3. Queue
   - Implementing Queue using Array.
   - Implementing Queue using LinkedList.
   - Circular Queue.

## Installation

To use the implementations in this repository, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. If you don't have one, you can install [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for Unix-like systems or [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) for Windows.

Next, you can clone this repository using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/MuhammedMagdyy/Data-Structures-O6U.git
```
Then, change to the project's directory
```
cd Data-Structures-O6U
```

Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract its contents to your desired location.

Happy coding!
